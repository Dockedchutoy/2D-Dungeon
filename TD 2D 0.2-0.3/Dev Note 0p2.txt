2D 0.2 Alpha is an unfinished and unreleased version of 2D Text Dungeon, which is evindent by the lack
of content in the Release folder.

Comparing the distro files of this version and the previous one, they are almost identical, save for
the addition of a TODO list and like, 5 lines of code to the inventory commands.

According to that to do list, this version was supposed to bring four changes: Firstly, the main
focus was actually making the inventory work and something, which was evident by those 5 lines of code
i mentioned earlier. If i remember correctly, you were supposed to equip and unequip weapons, drop
items, and use those items. Things like that. Second thing were the chests with loot, definitely
bearing those unused dynamites and probably adding other items as well. I already mentioned the 
weapon switching, and speaking of weapons, i also apparently wanted to nerf the UMG Hammer... Not
sure why i didn't outright remove it, or make it very rare chest loot instead. Maybe that was the idea.
I don't remember.

There's nothing left to say about this version, it was mostly only unfinished ideas.
